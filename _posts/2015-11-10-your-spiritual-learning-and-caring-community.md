# Your spiritual, learning, and caring community.

Founded in 1953, the Young Israel of Brookline has become New England's largest Orthodox congregation. Multi-generational families have created a dynamic and vibrant community which is welcoming to the many young professionals who come to Boston for school and training. This exciting mixture of people crosses all cultural, economic and professional lines. Whether as a new resident or a visiting guest, the Young Israel of Brookline has developed an international reputation for hachnassat orchim, extending hospitality to visitors and those in our kehilla.
